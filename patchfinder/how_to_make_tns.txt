To make a cas patch for other OS

you need:

Linux, Mac, or Bash on Windows 10
Wine, if on Mac or Linux (can't get wm command to work in firebird)
Java
arm-none-eabi toolchain in your $PATH
nspire-emu, and boot1/boot2

1) install the os into nspire-emu [in wine if on mac/linux]
2) enter debugger, type "k 10000000", then "c"
3) reset emulation
4) when progress bar is at end it will hit a breakpoint
5) in debugger type "wm os.bin 10000000 2000000" then "q"
6) move os.bin to patchfinder folder, cd to the patchfinder folder
7) run ./mkpatcher.sh os.bin out.tns [N or C for non-cas/cas OS]
   It will take a long time, maybe even 4 or 5 minutes
8) out.tns is your patcher! put it on the calculator in the /ndless/startup folder, or as /ndless/ndless_resources.tns if you don't want ndless
9) delete os.bin
