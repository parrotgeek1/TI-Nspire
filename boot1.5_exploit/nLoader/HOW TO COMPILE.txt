Requirements: arm-none-eabi toolchain in your $PATH, python3, zip, unzip, awk, binutils

cd to this directory (it uses relative paths...sorry)
Then run ./make_for_nMaker.sh or ./make_for_emulator.sh
make_for_nMaker.sh will produce an image which can be provided to nMaker along with tinspirecx_boot2_4.4.0.8.img.tns or tinspirecx_boot2_4.5.0.14.img.tns (only).
make_for_emulator.sh requires tinspirecx_boot2_4.5.0.14.img.tns to be in the boot1.5_exploit folder (you can edit the script to use 4.4.0.8 instead). It will produce an image which can be directly provided to Firebird or nspire-emu as a boot2 image.
