1.0 - 2020-12-09
----------------
Removed the ability to fully bypass protections preventing running OSes on the wrong model
Fixed progress bar (no "jumps" at the beginning and end)
Optimized the performance of the patcher; the boot time should now be equivalent to stock
Fixed compilation on Linux (find command problem)
Added support for Boot2 4.5.0
Added full support for all known OSes 3.0 and newer, including Ndless loading at boot where applicable. In order to install 3.0-3.3, you will need to use nSwitchOS, because boot2 3.9+ will reject OSes without a manifest.
Added the ability to boot any OS, including yet unknown ones, and retain the ability to downgrade via the maintenance menu. No more red screen.
